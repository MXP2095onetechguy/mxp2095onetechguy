# Contributing to {project-name}

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this [project]({your-github-repository-url-ok}) as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

Just don't contribute code that contains malware or anything bad (like anything that ruins russia).

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes. (I do not do this very rigorously, I don't have the time)
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License if not specified (No copyleft though)
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project if your license choice is not specified. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues]({your-github-repository-url-for-issues-ok})
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will not be licensed under a copyleft or a non open source license (No GPL, AGPL, MS-PL, MS-RL, or OSL, it's fine for the EPL , LGPL and the MPL).

It is fine to contribute public domain code.

Doing that means you are saying **"Thank you very much for the code, I will not give you the code back, we only care about the GPL! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! No, but fack off."** and we don't want rude people.
